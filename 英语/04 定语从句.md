## 一、概念
### 定从
**定语**：修饰/限定名词/代词
- *Mary is a beautiful girl.*(形容词/前置)
- *The girl in a black dress is Mary.*(介词短语/后置)
- *The girl being invited now a Mary.*(分词短语/后置)
- *I know the girl who was invited to the party.*(定语从句)

**定语从句**：来修饰/限定名词的一个句子
- 限制性定语从句：修饰/限定作用
- 非限制性定语从句：补充说明作用
- *I met your friend who is a doctor.*( *~~限制~~* 性定语从句)
- *I met your mother, who is a doctor.*( *~~非限制~~* 性定语从句)
- *Your mother, who is a doctr, likes reading.*( *~~非限制~~* 性定语从句)

### 关系词
**先行词**：被修饰的名词、代词
**关系词**：引导定语从句 + 指代先行词
- 关系代词：that which who whom whose as
- 关系副词：when where why
*例句:* 
- *Xue Zhiqian is a star ~~who/that~~ enjoys [[enormous]] popularity in China.*
- *This is a great invention ~~which/that~~ has changed the world.*
- *The noodles ~~(which/that)~~ I cooked were delicious.*
- *The girl ~~(who/whom)~~ we met yesterday is Lily.*
- *This is the child ~~whose~~ parents are doctors.*
- *I like the movie ~~whose~~ name is The Fast and The Furious.*

总结：关系代词 1）指人？指物？2）在句中做什么成分
 
that：指人指物，作主宾
which：指物，作主宾
who：指人，作主宾
whom：指人，作宾
whose：指人指物，作定语
*注：what 不引导定从*

*练习：*
- *The eggs ~~that/which~~ were in the basket were not fresh.*
- *He is the man ~~(who/whom)~~ you have been waiting for.*
- *He saw a house ~~whose~~ windows were all broken.*
注意：选项中有 Whose 优先考虑

### 答题步骤
一划二找三判断
1. 划出定语从句
2. 找出先行词
3. 判断从句缺不缺成分（缺：关系代词；不缺：关系副词）

## 二、考点
### 考点一：只能用 that
六种情况（前四种最重要）：

1. 先行词是不定代词
	（**something/anything/everything/nothing/all**/much/few/none）
	- *In China, parents always do everything ~~that~~(which/what/that/who) they can to raise their children.*

2. 前有序数词/最高级只能用 that
	- *This is the most interesting movie ~~that~~ I have seen this year.*
	- *This is the third book ~~that~~ I have finished this year.*

3. 前有 the only(仅仅)/the very(恰恰)/the right(正确的) 时，只能用 that
	- *Shanghai is the very place ~~that~~(where/in which/that/whose) both the Chinese and forginer are [[eager]] to vist.*

4. 先行词是“人 and 物”时，只能用 that
	- *They are talking about the people and the thing ~~that~~ they can remember.*

5. 由“which，who，whom”引导的问句中，为了避免重复，只用that
	- *Who is the man ~~that~~ you talked with just now?*

6. 当关系代词在句作表语时，只用 that
	- *Mary is no longer the girl ~~that~~ she used to be.*

### 考点二：不能用 that
1. 引导非限制性定语从句时，不用that
	- *Football, ~~which~~ is popular game, is played all over the world.*
	The building, *~~which~~*(that/which/what/when) was completed in 1856, was famous for its huge marble(大理石) [[staircases]].

2. 介词后不用 that
	- 介词后也不用 who
	- 介词后可以接 which(物)/whom(人)
	- *The tool with ~~which~~ he is working is called a hammer.*
	- 限定性定语从句:  名词做先行词
	- 非限制性定语从句: 句子做先行词
	- *He failed in the exam, ~~which~~ made his father angry.*

### 考点三：如何判断选择的是关系代词or关系副词
**从句**缺成分选关系代词，**从句**不缺成分选关系副词
- *I will never forget the days ~~that~~(when/who/whom/that) we spent togethe.*
- *I will never forget the days ~~when~~(which/when/who/that) you made*
  *such a great success.*

及物动词（vt.）：后面直接加名词或代词作宾语
**不及物动词（vi.）：不能直接加名词或代词作宾语**
go/come(to) arrive(at/in)
live(in) work(at/in) talk(to/with) stay(at) wait(for) grow(up/in)
**不及物动词单独使用不缺宾语；加介词后缺宾语用关系代词**
- *Yesterday we went to visit the house ~~where~~(who/where/which/whose) the great writer used to live.*
- *Yesterday we went to vist the house ~~which~~(who/where/which/whose) the great writer used to live in.*

### 考点四：被动语态（be done）不缺宾语
从句是被动语态，不缺宾语，用关系副词。
- *October 1st is the day ~~when~~(when/whine/that) New China was founded.*
- *Do you know the year ~~when~~(which/what/when/on which) the People's Republic of China was founded.*

不缺宾语的三种情况：
1. 不及物动词后不缺宾语
2. 被动语态不缺宾语
3. 句意完整不缺宾语

### 考点五：定语从句用 As “正如”和“正像”
as 可以放在句首引导定语从句 —— 固定搭配
- as we all know / as is known to all 众所周知
- as far as I know = I think  据我所知
- as we know/except/see/think/suppose  正如我们所知/所期/所见/所想/所认为
- as is often the case  情况常常如此
- the same...as...  和……一样
- such...as...  和……一样
- as...as...  和……一样
- so...as...  和……一样

- *I want to use the same dictionary ~~as~~ I used yesterday.*

### 考点六：关系词 whose
of = A of B：B 的 A
whose n. = the n. of which/whose

### 考点七：关系副词 = 介词 + 关系副词
情况1：看先行词并翻译
- *The engineer ~~with~~(in/on/which) whom my father works is an America.*
情况2：看固定搭配
- *He talked about a hero ~~of whom~~(of whom/for whom/of that/for that) no one heard.*

### 考点八：区别以下两种结构
- one of + pl. + 定从（谓语复数）
- the only/very/right one of + pl. + 定从（谓语单数）
- *例子：*
	- *She is one of the students who ~~were~~(was/were/is/are) praised at the meeting yesterday.*
	- *He is the only one of the students who ~~has been~~(is/are/have been/has been) a winner of scholarship for three years.*
	- *Mulan is one of the best films ~~that have~~(which have/which has/that have/that has) left a deep impression on me.*

### 考点九：特殊的先行词 the way
首选 in which 
- in which(首选) that /

### 考点十：抽象地点

| situation | 情况  | condition  | 情况  | case | 情况  | point    | 点   |
| --------- | --- | ---------- | --- | ---- | --- | -------- | --- |
| stage     | 阶段  | atmosphere | 氛围  | job  | 工作  | position | 职位  |
- *例子：*
	- *Now we are faced with a situation ~~where~~(where/that/which/on which) there is not enough money to apply to the project.*

### 考点十一：省略关系词
省略关系词 —— 从句必须缺宾语
选项中：选项多词：没有关系词+缺宾语 —— 优选
- *例子：*
	- *The washing machine ~~I bought~~(I bought/I bought it/which I buy/which I buy) at the mall last Wednesday works well.*

### 考点十二：插入语
I think/suppose/expect/believe/hope：我想/我认为/我期待/我相信/我希望
1. 位置：句中
2. 做题时，先删去插入语
- *例子：*
	- *The scholar has made another breakthrough, ~~which I think is~~(I think which is/which I think it is/which I think is/about which I think it is) of great value to the progress of science and technology.*
	注意：介词
	动词类：优先选介词
	从句类：不优先选介词
