## 考点一：引导词——主/宾/表从

- 连接代词：what | who | whom 
- 连接副词：that | whether/if | how | when | where | why
  - ever：
    whatever(无论什么) | whoever(无论是谁) | whomever(无论是谁)
    however(无论怎样) | whereever(无论在哪) | whenever(无论何时)



- 从句答题步骤：
  - （选项是引导词）> 往前看
  - 定语从句 > 一划二找三判断
  - 名词性从句 > 一划三判断




- what 指物作主宾（缺成分, 指物, 作主语/宾语）

### 二、who/whom

- who 指人作主宾
- whom 指人作宾
  - *Do you know ~~who~~(what/that/who/when) has own Red Alert game?*
  - *~~Whoever~~(Who/Whom/Whoever/Whomever) is to attend the party tomorrow will be given a beautiful small gift.*

### 三、that

- that 无词义（只有宾语从句可省，主语从句和表语从句 that 不可省）
- that：确定性语句（语义明确）
  - he finished writing the composition(作曲，写作) 
  - *His suggestion is ~~that~~(what/that/who/when) we should finish our homework.*
  - *~~That he will attend~~(He will attend/He attends/That he will attend/As he attends) the international conference on climate change next year is certain.*
  - *~~That~~(What/That/How/Which) she was invited to the dance made her very happy.*

### 四、whether/if

- whether/if：不缺，翻译成“是否”
- 不确定性：don't know | want to know | question/problem | ask 询问| unkown 未知的| uncertain 不确定的

- 不能用 if ，只能用 wether 的情况：
  1) if 不能引导主语从句和表语从句，只能引导宾语从句
  2) if 不能与 or not 连用（wether ... or not 是否 | wether A or B 无论是 A 还是 B ）
  3) 介词后不用 if

- *例句：*
  - *The  problem is ~~whether~~(what/that/if/whether) we can carry out(执行 实施) the plan.*
  - *We want to know ~~whether~~(what/whether/that/why) you accept our offer or not.*
  - *This is a very short distance. It doesn't ,matter ~~wether~~(this/whether/what/why) you go there by bus or on foot.*

### 总结

|      |                  定语从句                   |                    名词性从句                     |
| ---: | :-----------------------------------------: | :-----------------------------------------------: |
|   缺 | that \| which \| who \| whom \| whose \| as |                what \| who \| whom                |
| 不缺 |            when \| where \| why             | that \| whether/if \| how \| when \| where \| why |

**注意：**

- **定语从句中一定没有 what**
- **名词性从句中没有单独的 which**

## 考点二、宾语从句的语序为陈述语序

- 陈述句 <—— 疑问句/倒装

  - He can sing.——Can he sing?
  - He is a student.——Is he a student.
  - He has finished the homework.——Has he finish the home work?
  - He likes English. ——Does he like English?
  - 判断正误：
    - [ ] Please tell me when will you come back.
    - [x] Please tell me when you will come back.
  - 练习：
    - *Everyone won't know ~~what time the war began~~(what time would the war begin/what time does the war begin/what time the war began/what time will the war begin)*

## 考点三、宾语从句的时态

  - 主现从不限（如果从句用一般现在时，那么从句时态不受限制）
  - 主过从必过（如果从句用过去时态，那么从句时态用过去的某种时态）
  - 真理永一现
  - *例句：*
    - *He says that he ~~will go~~(go) to school tomorow.*
    - *He said that he ~~would go~~(go) to school the next day.*
    - *He said that the earth ~~is~~(is) round.*
    - *He wondered ~~what his wife's reaction would be~~(what his wife's reaction will be/what his wife's reaction would be/what  would his wife's reaction be/what  will his wife's reaction be).*


## 考点四、主语从句谓语动词单三

- *When we shall hold our sports meeting ~~is~~(is/are) not decided.*
- 特殊：what 引导主语从句 且 整个句子是主系表结构 | 看表语
  - *What we need ~~is~~(is/are) time.*
  - *What we need ~~are~~(is/are) good doctors.*

## 考点五、同位语从句

- The girl, my best friend, is Lucy.
  - 前名词 | 定语从句（修饰限定名词）
  - 前名词 | 同位语从句（解释说明前名词）
- 答题步骤：
  - 前名词 > 优先判断定语从句 > 行不通 > 同位语从句，(专升本)直接选 that
- 同位语从句前常有抽象名词：
  - news 消息 | idea 观点| fact 事实 | information | evidence 证据 | suggestion | promise | order | notice
- *例句：*
  - *They were happy to hear the news ~~that~~(which/that) he own the first prize.*
  - *The fact ~~that~~(which/that) our team has won the final match is encouraging.*
  - *The news ~~(which/that)~~(which/that) you told us is really encouraging.*
  - *The news ~~that~~(that/which/what/as) the Chinese women's football team had won the match excited all of us.*  
- 补充：
  - 【have no idea = don't know】 + 宾从
  - 【keep in mind = remember】+ 宾从

## 总结：名词性从句

- 主/宾/表 从：一划三判断
- 同位语从句： 前名词 > 优先判断定语从句 不缺 > 关系副词 | 不是时间/地点/原因 > 同位语从句 > that
- 宾语从句  ：陈述语序
- 时态 ：主现从不限 | 主过从必过 | 真理永一现
- 主语从句谓语动词单三
